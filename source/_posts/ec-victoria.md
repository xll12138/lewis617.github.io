## Victoria's Secret Fashion Show

> As Shanghai's Mercedes-Benz Arena turned pink on Monday evening, the 2017 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show made its debut in Asia. Undoubtedly, models offered us a wonderful Visual feast. During the show, Xi Mengyao, tumbled to the ground which did provoke a heat discuss. Some people showed their sympathy and encouragement to Ming while others held the view that it was a serious performance accident which couldn’t be easily forgiven. Do u pay attention to this show？What’s your attitude towards Ming’s  error？

I didn’t know it until I get this topic. I just want to say that everyone had a right to make mistakes. We should express our concern instead of being mean to her.

## Never sleep in school for more than three classes

> Recently, there was a picture named “Never sleep in school for more than three classes” which was widely spread on the internet. The picture is fairly funny. But after your laughter, do u recall something happened in your senior school? Do u miss your classmates, your teacher or the days fulfilled of pure happiness？Just share the thoughts with us.

The description of high school really reminds me of those three years with happiness and tears. I had the same experience just like what the topic said.

In some classes, due to the tedious courses, my classmates and I often had a free chat throughout the whole  class. Although the conversation was quite boring, it still helped us to kill plenty of time.

> This is an interesting drawing which describes several conflicts in our college life. It seemed that a tangible vicious spiral shut us in. How do u schedule your time? Can you balance these three things?

There was one thing came up in my mind when I first saw this triangle. That is stay in the middle and never go deep into one of the three corners.

How to balance? It’s quite simple to answer. Being good at time management.
